""" Logging functions for the James Webb Quicklook automation platform

Working notes: 
1) Will definitely want the same type of decorators that WFC3 QL uses - one
to track failures and one to track useful system information. Are there
any other things we will want to create a decorator for? Also which 
module version information will we want to track with our info decorator?

2) Do we want to follow the same naming convention stuff? Have the make_log_file 
function preform the same way?
