# The James Webb Quicklook Application 

One Paragraph of project description goes here.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

git

(Once we have more things we deem as prereqs for using and contributing to our project then we can add them here.) 

### Installing

You first need to install the current version of jwql. The simplest way to do this is to go to the directory you want your version to be in and clone the repoistory there. Once you are in the directory you can do the following: 

```
git clone https://github.com/spacetelescope/jwql.git
```

## Contributing

Be sure to talk about the [style guide](https://github.com/spacetelescope/jwql/blob/style-guide/style_guide/style_guide.md) and what's in there regarding this. 


### Make an issue on github

This is most easily done 

### Make a branch

### Best Practices:

As you go be sure to follow the steps:

    ```
    git add 'file.py'

    git commit -m " This is the first commit of the first code for this project. "

    git push
    
    *** The first time that you push your branch you will get a warning and first need to run this: 

    git push --set-upstream origin your_branch_name
    ```

Repeat! Feel free to repeat everytime you make a big change to your project and/or at the end of every work day to ensure you're keeping track of your work in incremental steps that make sense for you. 

### Switching Branches: 
When you are working on a project you will have made a branch to change or add files. But what if you now need to go back to the current version of the project to work on something else? You can switch your branch!

To check what branch you are on: 
```
git branch

```

To change to the current version of the project: 
```
git checkout -b master
```

To get up to date with the current version of the project:
```
git pull
```

### Merging your Branch with the Master Branch: 
What do you do once you've finished your addition or changes to the project and want to get it into the most recent version?

This is most easily done on the github website at the project page.
