# The James Webb Quicklook Application 

One Paragraph of project description goes here.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

It is highly suggested that users have a working installation of `anaconda` or `miniconda` for Python 3.6.  Downloads and installation instructions are  available here:

- [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)
- [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)

Following your installation of 'anaconda' or 'miniconda' we also require the following packages which you can add to your conda environment: 

git
flake8

Requirements for working in the ``jwql`` repository will be included in the `jwqldev` `conda` environment, which is included in our installation instructions below. Further package requirements will be provided for ``jwql`` by a `setup.py` script included in the git download. 

(Once we have more things we deem as prereqs for using and contributing to our project then we can add them here.) 

### Installation

You first need to install the current version of ``jwql``. The simplest way to do this is to go to the directory you want your version to be in and clone the repoistory there. Once you are in the directory you can do the following: 

```
git clone https://github.com/spacetelescope/jwql.git
```

## Environment Installation

Following the download of the `jwql` codes, users can then install the `jwqldev` `conda` environment via the `environment.yml` file, which contains all of the dependencies for the project:

```
cd jwql
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

We have further in-depth instructions on how to install your environtment at the following project wikipage: https://github.com/spacetelescope/jwql/wiki/Environment-Installation

## Contributing

There are two current pages to review before you begin contributing to the `jwql` development. The first is our [style guide](https://github.com/spacetelescope/jwql/blob/style-guide/style_guide/style_guide.md) and the second is our [suggested git workflow page](https://github.com/spacetelescope/jwql/wiki/git-GitHub-workflow-for-contributing/). 

The following is a bare bones example of a best work flow for contributing to the project. 

The usual roadmap that you will want to follow is to: 
1. 

We provide an in-depth best practices workflow at [this project wikipage](https://github.com/spacetelescope/jwql/wiki/git-GitHub-workflow-for-contributing/).
