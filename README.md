# The James Webb Quicklook Application

One Paragraph of project description goes here.

## Prerequisites

It is highly suggested that users have a working installation of `anaconda` or `miniconda` for Python 3.6.  Downloads and installation instructions are  available here:

- [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)
- [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)

(Once we have more things we deem as prereqs for using and contributing to our project then we can add them here.)

## Installation

Users first need to install the current version of `jwql`. The simplest way to do this is to go to the directory you want your version to be in and clone the repoistory there. Once you are in the directory you can do the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/spacetelescope/jwql.git
```

Users can then install the `jwqldev` `conda` environment via the `environment.yml` file, which contains all of the dependencies for the project:

```
cd jwql
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

(Once `jwql` is offically a package, we should put instructions here on how to run the `setup.py` script.)


## Contributing

Be sure to talk about the [style guide](https://github.com/spacetelescope/jwql/blob/style-guide/style_guide/style_guide.md) and what's in there regarding this.

Also reference the wiki for contributing (https://github.com/spacetelescope/jwql/wiki/git-GitHub-workflow-for-contributing)
Then there is no need to outline the workflow in this README.


## Versioning
See our [style guide](https://github.com/spacetelescope/jwql/blob/style-guide/style_guide/style_guide.md) (will place summary in here as well).
