# The James Webb Quicklook Application 

One Paragraph of project description goes here.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

git

(Once we have more things we deem as prereqs for using and contributing to our project then we can add them here.) 

### Installing

You first need to install the current version of jwql. The simplest way to do this is to go to the directory you want your version to be in and clone the repoistory there. Once you are in the directory you can do the following: 

```
git clone https://github.com/spacetelescope/jwql.git
```

## Contributing

Be sure to talk about the [style guide](https://github.com/spacetelescope/jwql/blob/style-guide/style_guide/style_guide.md) and what's in there regarding this. 


### Make an issue on github

### Make a branch

### Best Practices:

(1) As you go be sure to follow the steps:
    (a) git add ----
    (b) git commit -m " "
    (c) git push ----
        *The first time that you push your branch you will get a warning and first need to run this: 
        ```
        git push --set-upstream origin ----
        ```


## Versioning
See our [style guide](https://github.com/spacetelescope/jwql/blob/style-guide/style_guide/style_guide.md) (will place summary in here as well).
